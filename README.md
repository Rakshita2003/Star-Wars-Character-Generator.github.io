# Star-Wars-Character-Generator.github.io
Built with jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5. This webpage randomly selects a Star Wars character and fetches their information using the https://akabab.github.io/starwars-api/ API. After pressing the button GENERATE, the results are shown on the webpage, as well as the status of the Ajax request. The project is similar to the Radnom_Star_Wars_Character_Webpage but the communication with the API is done using jQuery in order to show the advantage of using the library.
